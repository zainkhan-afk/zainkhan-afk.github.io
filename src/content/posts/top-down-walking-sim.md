# Top Down Walking

Legged animals and robots walk by exerting a force on the ground that allows them to propel their bodies forward. Therefore, the direction in which the force has been exerted and the direction of the movement caused by this force are antiparallel to one another i.e., they are in opposite directions.

In order to make a physics based top down walking simulation, the contact forces and their resulting accelerations must be correctly modeled and implemented.

Before implementing the walking simulation, let's discuss the process of how the forces are exerted and what their effect on the body are.

## How walking works

As the name suggests, bipedal walking is achieved by using two legs. The movement of the two legs determines how the
