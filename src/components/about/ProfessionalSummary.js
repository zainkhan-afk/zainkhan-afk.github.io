        I love building intelligent systems that combine AI, creativity, and real-world impact.
        My background includes building healthcare AI systems, research in robotics, freelancing
        as a machine learning and computer vision engineer, and experimenting with creative
        coding projects. Whether it’s deploying production-ready ML pipelines or exploring the
        artistic side of code, I’m motivated by learning, building, and sharing solutions that
        matter.
